# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA

## Overview
In this project, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset with the aim of developing a predictive model that is focused on regression. Simply put, a **regression** objective entails predicting a particular value for a numeric outcome variable, like a student's test score or a worker's income, based on various observable factors, called **features**.
For this section, I worked with a data set that's aimed at predicting a numeric estimate of diabetes progression one year after a baseline. In other words, for each patient (observation), the goal is to predict a numeric score indicating diabetes progression one year after their blood pressure, body mass index, and blood sugar level were recorded.

## Objective
1. Perform EDA using a set of very simple and easy-to-memorize Python commands
2. Interpret key EDA plots and statistics
3. Improve a prediction model by using information obtained through EDA
4. Perform basic feature engineering
5. Detect and handle outliers
6. Deal with missing data

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- pandas for managing the data
- NumPy for mathematical operations
- SciPy for additional mathematical operations beyond those provided by numpy
- sklearn for machine learning and machine learning pipeline-related functions
- seaborn for visualizing the data
- Matplotlib for additional plotting tools
- MissingNo for missing data analysis and visualizations
- fasteda for fast and easy EDA

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter notebook `ignEDA.ipynb` to see the analysis.
2. You can also run the `ignEDA.py` script directly.
